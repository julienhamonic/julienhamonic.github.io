The secret to success and wealth is to follow one's dream and to execute it.<br>
To do that we must be receptive to our vision while discarding any negative thought and not feel ashamed or guilty.
<br><br>
We surely possess free will along the way, which is the liberty to receive a certain thought form from the ether, 
to tune in to a certain thought vibration or wave at a certain moment.
<Br><Br>
The brain is a transceiver for waves, positive and negative (emotions and thought forms).<br>
You have the choice to pick up the ones that are positively polarized and generate in effect positive thought forms only, 
and thus attract and accumulate wealth.
<br><br>
More concretely, the pineal gland and other receptors allow us to pick up waves that vibrate at a much higher rate than the range sensed by our material physical 5 senses,
and this is what you want to observe.
<br><br>
While doing business, what are the advantages of telling what you observe (1) vs observing what you are told (2)? <br>
You are in control and put yourself in the timeline of your choice (1) <br>
vs <br>
You are under control and put yourself in the timeline of their choice (2)
<br> <br>
Money is to be made in former case since you are rewarded within a process (convenants)that you control.
<br><br>
The latter case: you might be stolen, taken advantage of or lied to in a false hope selling scheme.
