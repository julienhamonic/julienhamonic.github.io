title: 'Money is abstract and ruled by a plane higher than the physical one'
---

Contrary to most people think, Money is abstract and ruled by a plane higher than the physical one.
<br>
Because money is the representation of the energetic reward for services and goods one human entity might provide for others.
<br>
<br>
To Take control of your life and your money, the key is to elevate yourself into a higher plane than the physical one.
<br>
Dont fall prey of ideas fixed in your mind and outside of it.<br>
The physical plane is fixed.<br>
The moment you tune your mind to the physical plane, you fall prey to a reality that is fixed and of which you have not control.<br>
<br>
See the physical reality, but dont look at it.<br>
Because Dreams are only generated and visible in higher realms.<br>
Happiness and freedom are to be found there.<br>
