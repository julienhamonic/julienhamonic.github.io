title: 'Reality is a theater projected from your mind'
---

The physical plane is the subtrate where we see the resultant of what we actually do in higher realms.
More geometrically speaking, our paths in the physical realm are the trace of our deliberate actions in the emotional plane.
We are passive in the projected plane.
We are active in the space from which we project.

To the businessman, the question is: 
Do you focus on effects of actions or causes that put them into effect?
Money and happiness is where there's control, that is of course the latter case.
Causes pertain to Ethereality (dimension 4). Effects pertain to Reality (dimension 3).

Other questions:
 - what plays the role of the projector?
