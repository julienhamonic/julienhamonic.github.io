title: 'Reality is a theater projected from your mind'
---

The physical plane is the subtrate where we see the resultant of what we actually do in higher realms.<br>
More geometrically speaking, our paths in the physical realm are the trace of our deliberate actions in the emotional plane.<br>
We are passive in the projected plane.<br>
We are active in the space from which we project.<br>

To the businessman, the main question is: <br>
Do you focus on the effects of actions or the causes that put them into effect?<br>
Money and happiness can be reached if you are in control, that is of course the latter case.<br>
Causes pertain to Ethereality (dimension 4). Effects pertain to the physical Reality (dimension 3).
<br><br>
Other questions:

- What plays the role of the projector?

The pineal gland (contains a high density of piezoelectric crystals).<br>
The physical reality is the space where you project what you see in these higher realms.<br>
Work on the Ethereal space and then reap the effects on and within the material reality.<br>

- How can we reach and work within the Ethereal space?
 
Through the pineal gland.<br>
It is also the portal to these spaces of higher dimensions, Ethereality, Emotional plane, Astral Plane, Concepts and so forth.
<br> 
One can go back and forth between the physical (solid and fixed reality) and the ethereal world (dream astral state) trough this internal portal.
If you can do this at a high rate of vibration, you reach the state of so called geniuses.
