Julien Hamonic <br>
I am hyper-focused on building teams based in the blockchain space. <br>

Services: <br>
I know hiring is hard. I’ll make it much easier for you. <br>
The best companies are driven by rock-solid teams. <br>
I invest in my partners by obtaining equity in exchange for service (continual search) rendered. <br>
For every search I conduct a thorough analysis of an industry, and systematically identify every qualified candidate in the marketplace. This process of sourcing generates a concentrated list of candidates without regard to their interest in a career change. <br>
I will work with you tirelessly to help construct your ultimate dream-team. <br>
From engineers to co-founders up to advisors and CxO, and from writing job descriptions to closing a hire, I’ve got your talent requirements covered. It’s all part of the deal. <br>
Typically, I am your VP of talent sitting on your board of directors in your company to start the team that will build or consolidate a prototype,a product to attract investors or users. <br>
I can find engineers, hackers, investors, potentially anybody. <br>
