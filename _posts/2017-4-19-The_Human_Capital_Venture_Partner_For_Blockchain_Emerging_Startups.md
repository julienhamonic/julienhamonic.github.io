Services:
I know hiring is hard. I’ll make it much easier for you.
The best companies are driven by rock-solid teams.
I invest in my partners by obtaining equity in exchange for service (continual search) rendered. 
For every search I conduct a thorough analysis of an industry, and systematically identify every qualified candidate in the marketplace. This process of sourcing generates a concentrated list of candidates without regard to their interest in a career change. 
I will work with you tirelessly to help construct your ultimate dream-team. 
From engineers to co-founders up to advisors and CxO, and from writing job descriptions to closing a hire, I’ve got your talent requirements covered. It’s all part of the deal.
Typically, I am your VP of talent sitting on your board of directors in your company to start the team that will build or consolidate a prototype,a product to attract investors or users.
I can find engineers, hackers, investors, potentially anybody.
