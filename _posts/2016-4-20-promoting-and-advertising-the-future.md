title: 'Promoting and Advertising the Future'
---

As Human Capital providers (aka human venture capitalist) at Descartes Search LLC, we are laser-focused on future technologies.
We are actively looking for early stage companies especially in the following sectors:

- Artificial Intelligence

- Robotics

- Blockchain

- Hardware

- Computer Science

- Virtual Reality 

We recruit and provide our precious human assets for companies that can and will _impact the world_.

Great engineers (assets) will work exclusively for companies that have an _exciting future_ and that is what we _promote in interim_, towards our human capital that we can now attract, capture and retain.

There's a huge difference between _to attract_ someone and _to retain_ him -- the strength, the power and the truth of the advertising message and that depends on whether or not the client company has an _amazing future_ or not.

Because we are very oriented towards new companies that are starting up products for gigantic mass-market appeal, we are the perfect partner for Venture Capital firms.

Contact Descartes Search LLC [here](http://descartes-search.com/contact_en.php) or Satoshiscollar [here](http://satoshiscollar.jp/im-hiring/) if you are interested in our Human Capital.
